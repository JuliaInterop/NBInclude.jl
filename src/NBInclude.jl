"""
The NBInclude module allow you to include and execute Julia code from
IJulia Jupyter notebooks.  Analogous to `include("myfile.jl")`, just do

    using NBInclude
    nbinclude("myfile.ipynb")

to include the Julia code from the notebook `myfile.ipynb`.  Like `include`,
the value of the last evaluated expression is returned.

"""
    my_include_string(s::AbstractString, path::AbstractString, prev)

Like include_string, but also change the current source path just
as `include(filename)` would do.   We are hacking undocumented internals
of Julia here (see `base/loading.jl:include_from_node1`), but it hasn't
changed from Julia 0.2 to Julia 0.4 so it's not too crazy.  `prev`
should be the previous path returned by `Base.source_path`.

"""
    nbinclude(path::AbstractString; renumber::Bool=false, counters=1:typemax(Int), regex::Regex=r"", anshook = identity)

Include the IJulia Jupyter notebook at `path` and execute the code
cells (in the order that they appear in the file), returning the
result of the last expression in the last code cell.

Similarly to `include(path)` for `.jl` files, the `path` is relative
to the path of the current file (if any), and nested calls to
`include` or `nbinclude` are relative to the path of the notebook file.

For code in the `N`-th input cell of the notebook, the `@__FILE__` macro
(and other code that uses the file name, e.g. exception backtraces)
returns `path:In[N]`, where `N` is the cell number saved in the notebook.
If the cell has no number (e.g. if it hasn't been evaluated yet), then
it is assigned a number `+N` for the `N`-th nonempty cell.  If `renumber`
is set to `true`, then the cell numbers saved in the notebook are ignored
and each cell is assigned a consecutive number `N`.

`counters` and `regex` can be used to include only a subset of notebook cells.
Only cells for which `counter âˆˆ counters` holds and the cell text matches `regex`
are executed. E.g.

    nbinclude("notebook.ipynb"; counters = 1:10, regex=r"# *exec"i)

would include cells 1 to 10 from "notebook.ipynb" that contain comments like
`# exec` or `# ExecuteMe` in the cell text.

`anshook` can be used to execute a function on all the values returned in the cells.
